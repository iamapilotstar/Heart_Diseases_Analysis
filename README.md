## **📌 Project Overview**  
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This app helps predict **heart disease risk** based on medical parameters such as:  
✔ **Age**  
✔ **Cholesterol Levels**  
✔ **Blood Pressure**  
✔ **Chest Pain Type**  
✔ **Heart Rate & ECG Readings**  
✔ **ST Depression & Exercise Induced Angina**  

Using these clinical indicators, the model predicts whether the patient is **likely** or **unlikely** to have heart disease.

## **📊 How It Works**  
1️⃣ **User Inputs Medical Details** → Age, cholesterol, ECG, chest pain, etc.  
2️⃣ **Data is Preprocessed & Scaled** → Standardization using **StandardScaler**.  
3️⃣ **Machine Learning Model Predicts the Outcome** → Outputs **Heart Disease / No Heart Disease**.  
4️⃣ **Displays Probability & Visualization** → Bar chart for better insight.

## **🔍 Key Insights from Model**  
- **Chest Pain Type (Asymptomatic)** and **ST Depression** are the strongest indicators of heart disease.  
- **Cholesterol & Age Ratio** plays a significant role in risk assessment.  
- **Max Heart Rate (HR) and Exercise-Induced Angina** show strong correlations with disease presence.
